Python 3.6.3 instaled

pipenv-1 (pipenv set to some id with virutal ENV)
    Machine Learning (project)
    -requests- 1.2 (library)

pipenv-2 
    Django Web API
    -requests - 2.0 (diff requests library)

Breaks code becuase different dependncy versions for requests since it overrode requests in machine learning project

pipenv allows u manage differnet dependcies so it doesnt break code
